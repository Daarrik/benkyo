# Benkyo

### About

<b>Benkyo</b> is a React Native application for studying the readings of Japanese words, built specifically for Android. Benkyo is a passion project (and final project for CS 4750) written in two weeks. Much, if not all, of the messy code from those two weeks has been removed.

### To-Do

1. Database for storing words and their readings outside of memory

2. Useful study application features like number of times correct/incorrect
